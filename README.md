# Dotnet-Core

A Todo API (Yeah, yet another one) to explore some of the command line and basics of .NET Core 3.x.

Code is based on the tutorial at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio-code>

I am using the following for this coding exercise:

1. Windows 10
2. Visual Studio Code
3. .NET Core SDK 3.1.403 x64
